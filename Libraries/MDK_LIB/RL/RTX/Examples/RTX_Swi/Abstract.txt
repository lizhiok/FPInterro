This example program shows how to implement software interrupt 
functions in RTX Kernel application. The tasks in this example
do nothing more than increment a 5-bit counter or add a fixed
value to it. Incrementing a global 5-bit counter is compiled
to a multi-instruction code sequence which should not be 
interrupted by another task. 

It includes the SWI_Table.s file which implements the SWI function
table. The SWI function declarations and implementations are 
demonstrated in the RTX_Swi.c file.


The RTX_SWI example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
           - watch the variables in Watch #1 window
