Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing
button that lets pedestrians cross.  The lights are
connected to Port 1. You can see this in action using
uVision Debugger. 

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in TRAFFIC.C. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  Serial I/O is interrupt and event driven.  Look at
   SERIAL.C for the complete, encapsulated module (you
   may want to use this in your programs).


The TRAFFIC example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
           - watch the variables in Watch #1 window
