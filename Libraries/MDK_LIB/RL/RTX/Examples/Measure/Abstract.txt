The MEASURE program uses analog and digital inputs to
simulate a datalogger. It runs with RTX Kernel real time
executive. This example shows how you can use the RTX
Kernel and signal functions in uVision to simulate a signal
coming into one of the analog inputs.

You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of
the S2 switch on MCB21xx evaluation boards. The jumper settings
are described below.

The MEASURE  example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
