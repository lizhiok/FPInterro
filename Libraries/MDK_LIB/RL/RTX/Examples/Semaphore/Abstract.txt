This is a simple RTX Kernel based example that uses a binary semaphore
to share the serial line. Two tasks are defined:

task1: A task with high priority, that is executed every 30ms, and
       sends a short string "Task1" via UART1. When a delay of 30ms
       has expired, it waits for a free semaphore for 10ms.
       If the semaphore is not free it will not send the string.

task2: A task with low priority, running whenever no other task with
       higher priority is active. It sends a short string "Task2" 
       via UART1 when the semaphore is free. If the semaphore is 
       in use, it will wait. 

The Semaphore example program is available for one target:
