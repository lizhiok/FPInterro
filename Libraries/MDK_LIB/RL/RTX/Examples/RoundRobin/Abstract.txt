This example program uses RTX Kernel and shows round-robin task
switching. Two tasks (task 1 and task 2) are executing at 
priority 2 while task 3 is executing at priority 4.

The task execution of task 1 and task 2 is interrupted by round robin
task switches. You may verify this using the Watch Window #1
that displays the increments of counter1, counter2, and counter3.

The low priority task 4 with a priority of 1 will never execute and
will always stay ready. This is because one of the higher priority 
tasks is always running. You may verify this in the Watch Window #1
where the value of counter4 is always 0.

The ROUNDROBIN program is available for one target:
